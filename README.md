# Hello

## Mobile 

  I've switched from a stock Samsung Galaxy S22, to a Google Pixel 7, with [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) installed. It's only been a few days so far, but immediately it feels so, freeing. No Google, Samsung, Microsoft, or Facebook apps are pre-installed, and there's no restriction to what you can do. And whats so cool to me is that there's no restriction, to how many restrictions you can place on an app. By default, any apps you install cant even access the internet, you have to enable that *yourself.* I love it! Not all apps need the internet, yet on other devices they have access to it nonetheless. Plus GrapheneOS lets you use your phone however you want, even more then what stock Samsung/Google phones give you, which is alot. But, on stock Samsung/Google phones you dont get the *same* level of control. Plus, Google and Samsung are planning to take those freedoms away for the sake of *"security".* Which is, lets be real, complete and total bullshit. 
  
## Desktop 
  I absolutely *love* Linux, and ive been dual booting [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/) for a while now. But making the FULL switch over is, difficult. It's not difficult because i dont understand Linux, the terminal just kinda clicked for me. It's difficult for two main reasons. Number one being that, windows is sadly the standard, and not everything caters to Linux, i have alternatives, and most (if not all) of the things i use work on Linux. But what if i *need* something that works on windows *only*? Yes, i know about virtual machines, but they arent the answer for everything. Windows is just the supported standard. The second reason is just, habit. Linux is great, and i try my absolute best to use it when i can, like right now, when im typing this. But there's a lot of habits that i've picked up from windows that are hard to break. But, nevertheless i plan to switch to Linux, *entirely* within the next five years, for my own sake. Alot of what i say as "reasons" why i havent switched to linux are admittedly just excuses. Im comfortable with windows because i know everything will work. Its just not the same with Linux, but i know it's so much better to switch, both for privacy, and efficency. You get the *most* performance out of your system with Linux, and that's what i want. TLDR; Linux is great and fits my needs, im just too comfortable with windows and am scared to switch, but will force myself to within 5 years.
